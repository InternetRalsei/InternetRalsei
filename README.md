# Hai!!

My name is Thomas Hall (aka RalziTech), and I'm a 15y/o editor/gamer/anti i-w*n/LekrkoekjBSR fan, hailing from Greenhithe, United Kingdom that knows how to write HTML code, among other things. You've probably seen me on the internet and have never even noticed.

## My current interests

- ~~i-win~~ LekrkoekjBSR
- Trains
- Buses
- Computers

## My current projects
- [WixView - Making Wix websites a breeze!](https://github.com/ralzitech/wixview)
  - WixView is a project which I started with [Jibbosh](https://github.com/jibbosh) that allows users to view Wix websites without the annoying "This website was created with Wix" banner at the top of the screen. I started this project in March 2025, and is on it's first release
