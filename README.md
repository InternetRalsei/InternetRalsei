# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thomas Hall, and I'm a 13 year old amateur programmer from England!

- Games (specifically Roblox and Rec Room)

- And just trying to be a help to society!

## Where can I reach you?

## Do you have a website?

I actually have multiple websites, but my main one is actually hosted on Google Sites. (https://sites.google.com/view/wavetecrr)


## Can I add you on Rec Room?

Yes, you can! https://rec.net/user/WavetecRR

## Do you have Linktree?

Yes I do! https://linktr.ee/waveteclife

## What phone do you use?

This may come as a suprise to many, but I main a Spacetalk Adventurer, because my parents are rather worried about me getting lost. (understandable tbh)

Anyway, thats all for now! Have a good one man!
