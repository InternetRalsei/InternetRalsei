# Hai!!

My name is Thomas Hall (aka Ralzitech, ShrinelinkXD), and I'm a 15y/o editor/gamer/anti i-w*n/Pro CGCristi/LekrkoekjBSR fan from Dartford, United Kingdom that knows how to write HTML code, among other things. You've probably seen me on the internet and have never noticed.

## Explaining my current GitHub display name

If you've checked my profile itself, you may have seen that my displayname has changed to "Ralzi | unblock me i-win you salty ass motherfcker". The reason being is that the popular YouTuber known as i-win has blocked me on everything over a bio change (which is now only visible here on GitHub). I'm also temporarily using her profile photo just to mess with her a little bit, but I might change this later on.

## My current interests

- ~~i-win~~ LekrkoekjBSR
- Trains
- Buses
- Computers

## Contact

If you do wish to contact me, keep in mind that I use :3, <3, and :) often, and I try to keep my responses as short as possible. 
If you need a full version of what I'm trying to say, ask me.
