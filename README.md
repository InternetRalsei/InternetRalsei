# Hai!!

My name is Thomas Hall (aka RalziTech), and I'm a 15y/o editor/gamer, hailing from Greenhithe, United Kingdom that knows how to write HTML code, among other things. You've probably seen me on the internet and have never even noticed.

## My current interests

- Trains
- Buses
- Computers
- The history of TV in the UK
- Artifyber

## Let the past be the past
If you haven't heard already, me and i-win have made up for past dramas. As a result, all of the content that I am aware of that mentions i-win in a negative way will be removed, and I'm sure that i-win will tell me what I need to remove.

## My current projects
- [WixView - Making Wix websites a breeze!](https://github.com/ralzitech/wixview)
  - WixView is a project which I started with [Jibbosh](https://github.com/jibboshh) that allows users to view Wix websites without the annoying "This website was created with Wix" banner at the top of the screen. We started this project in March 2025, and is on it's first release 

## Contact

If you do wish to contact me, keep in mind that I use :3, <3, and :) often, and I try to keep my responses as short as possible.
