# Hai!!

My name is Thomas Hall (aka RalziTech), and I'm a 15y/o editor, gamer and computer programmer from Greenhithe, United Kingdom that knows how to write HTML and Python code, among other things. You've probably seen me on the internet and have never even noticed.

## Let the past be the past and the past before that further in the past and let the further past be further in the past and let the further further past be in the further further further past and so on and so forth
If you haven't heard already, me and i-win have made up for past dramas. As a result, all of the content that I am aware of that mentions i-win in a negative way will be removed, and I'm sure that i-win will tell me what I need to remove.

## My current projects
- [WixView - Making Wix websites a breeze!](https://github.com/ralzitech/wixview)
  - WixView is a project which I started with [Jibbosh](https://github.com/jibboshh) that allows users to view Wix websites without the annoying "This website was created with Wix" banner at the top of the screen. We started this project in March 2025, and is on it's first release
- [win31](https://github.com/ralzitech/win31)
  - win31 is essentially a webwrapper for PCJs' Windows 3.1 Emulator. [It is available for you to try in your browser right now, provided that it is working](https://ralzitech.com/win31)
- [Acht Tausend Mause (Eight Thousand Mice)](https://github.com/ralzitech/achttausendmause)
  - Acht Tausend Mause (which is German for Eight Thousand Mice) is a game in which you select the right amount of mice to reach eight thousand. It's a fairly simple game, but one where you need to use your brain to add up to eight thousand
